#SAMPLE OF BASIC C++ CODING KNOWLEDGE

This series of exercices are samples of basic knowledge I acquired over the last few months, as I began programming.

These exercices contain exercices about variables and control flows.

Assignment 10 is probably the most substantial, especially the "v2-Vector-Erasing-Version".
